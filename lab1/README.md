# Lab 1 

In this lab assignment, we will practice the basics of data-intensive programming by setting up HDFS, HBase, Hadoop MapReduce, Spark, and Spark SQL and implementing simple applications on them. In this lab, we are given a dataset and a set of questions, and we implement codes for each question.
