# Final Project: Real-Time Bitcoin Price Predictions with News Sentiment Analysis

### Problem description
Cryptocurrency prices are known to behave differently compared to traditional currencies. Therefore it is extra difficult to determine what leads to the volatility of bitcoin prices. It is a challenge to correctly predict the future bitcoin prices. One way to do so is to collect data from news articles regarding cryptocurrency to see if there are significant effects on the price of bitcoin.
The problem statement of our project is thus to analyse whether and how real-time bitcoin prices are affected by cryptocurrency news. The goal is to predict real-time
bitcoin prices with natural language processing, specifically sentiment analysis, on news about cryptocurrency.
